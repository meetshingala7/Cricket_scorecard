# Cricket_scorecard

The program Cricket Scoresheet.c is a fully automated code and act as cricket scorer. We derived this idea from the APP - CricHeroes. <br>We created this program in the fall of 2021 (oct'21 and nov'21). This program has main_menu function which will first make you enter the playing XI of both the teams and Name of the teams for display. We have provided the cricket scorer with options to go with our default names(from the 2021 Eng vs Ind Series)<br>
The Default team members are:
India
1. Rohit
2. Rahul
3. Ishan
4. Kohli
5. Yadav
6. Dhoni
7. Thakur
8. Ashwin
9. Shami
10. Jassi
11. Jadeja

2. Root
3. Morgan
4. Jos
5. Malan
